![Laura Kalbag, Accessibility For Everyone. Foreword by Heydon Pickering. Number 23 from A Book Apart, brief books for people who make websites.](./images/cover.png)

Hello friends. You mightâ€™ve heard that [Accessibility For Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone) and all A Book Apart books are no longer available to buy from A Book Apart. 

**The book will be available to read and buy from here very soon!**

The good news is that all of us authors have got our book rights and are moving to self-publishing, and most of these books are now available to buy, borrow, and rent in many different locations.

To start, I lowered the price of the book. It may still be available for a while from the locations below. In the next couple of months, I intend to make it easier to access, so stay tuned!
