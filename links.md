# Buy Accessibility for Everyone

Hello friends. You might’ve heard that Accessibility For Everyone, along with all the A Book Apart books, are no longer available to buy from A Book Apart. The good news is that all of us authors have got our book rights, are moving to self-publishing, and most of these books are now available to buy, borrow, and rent in many different locations.

To start, I’ve lowered the price of the book. Over the next couple of months I intend to make the book even easier to access, so stay tuned!
